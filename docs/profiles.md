## **ako**

> A Windows ransomware that will run certain tasks to prepare the target system for the encryption of files. MedusaLocker avoids executable files, probably to avoid rendering the targeted system unusable for paying the ransom. It uses a combination of AES and RSA-2048, and reportedly appends extensions such as .encrypted, .bomber, .boroff, .breakingbad, .locker16, .newlock, .nlocker, and .skynet.

## **alphv**

> ALPHV, also known as BlackCat or Noberus, is a ransomware family that is deployed as part of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations. ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.ALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.

## **blackbasta**

> "Black Basta" is a new ransomware strain discovered during April 2022 - looks in dev since at least early February 2022 - and due to their ability to quickly amass new victims and the style of their negotiations, this is likely not a new operation but rather a rebrand of a previous top-tier ransomware gang that brought along their affiliates.

| [`The Spooner Risk Control`](https://google.com/search?q=The+Spooner+Risk+Control) | 23/04/2023 | The Spooner Risk Control family of companies was established in 1975, when Tom Spooner uprooted his youngest son from his bedroom so it could be turned into an office. What started as a labor relations and HR consulting firm has grown to offer solutions for many of the challenges that employers face today.Spooner‚Äôs journey into workers‚Äô compensation started in 1981, when a client asked Tom to attend an Industrial Commission hearing on behalf of their company. The client felt they‚Äôd paid more than enough for this particular workers‚Äô comp claim, but the Hearing Officer didn‚Äôt consider that a valid argument. However, the Hearing Officer suggested that Tom read the Ohio Revised Code Workers‚Äô Compensation book, since it was clear he truly wanted to protect and help the businesses he works with.  Nearly 50 years later, that remains the goal of every company under the Spooner umbrella. In 2017, Tom‚Äôs grandson Joe Spooner stepped into the role of president to ensure the company‚Äôs values continue to align with those ideals.SITE: https://spoonerinc.com Address 28605 Ranney ParkwayWestlake, Ohio 44145Phone: 440-249-5260 ext. 153 | <a href="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/baf1004a1697738f7e9765f9df5012a7.png" target=_blank>üì∏</a> |

## **conti**

> Conti is an extremely damaging ransomware due to the speed with which it encrypts data and spreads to other systems. It was first observed in 2020 and it is thought to be led by a Russia-based cybercrime group that goes under the Wizard Spider pseudonym. In early May 2022, the US government announced a reward of up to $10 million for information on the Conti ransomware gang.

## **ech0raix**

> The QNAPCrypt ransomware works similarly to other ransomware, including encrypting all files and delivering a ransom note. However, there are several important differences:1. The ransom note was included solely as a text file, without any message on the screen‚Äînaturally, because it is a server and not an endpoint.2. Every victim is provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet‚Äîthis could help the attackers avoid being traced.3. Once a victim is compromised, the malware requests a wallet address and a public RSA key from the command and control server (C&C) before file encryption.

## **hellokitty**

> Unit42 states that HelloKitty is a ransomware family that first surfaced at the end of 2020, primarily targeting Windows systems. The malware family got its name due to its use of a Mutex with the same name: HelloKittyMutex. The ransomware samples seem to evolve quickly and frequently, with different versions making use of the .crypted or .kitty file extensions for encrypted files. Some newer samples make use of a Golang packer that ensures the final ransomware code is only loaded in memory, most likely to evade detection by security solutions.

## **lorenz**

> Tesorion describes Lorenz as a ransomware with design and implementation flaws, leading to impossible decryption with tools provided by the attackers. A free decryptor for 2021 versions was made available via the NoMoreRansom initiative. A new version of the malware was discovered in March 2022, for which again was provided a free decryptor, while the ransomware operators are not able to provide tools to decrypt affected files.

## **prolock**

> PwndLocker is a ransomware that was observed in late 2019 and is reported to have been used to target businesses and local governments/cities. According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.

It was first seen within open-source documents in December 2019, two months after Mespinoza ransomware was spotted in the wild.

## **revil**

> Sodinokibi ransomware group also known as REvil (Ransomware Evil) operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. After the group compromised his victims, they would threaten to publish the victim's sensitive data on their darknet blog named 'Happy Blog', unless the ransom is paid. The ransomware malware code used by REvil is pretty similar to the ransomware code used by DarkSide - a different threat actor. REvil group claims to steal information after a successful attack on the supplier of the tech giant Apple and stole confidential schematics of their upcoming products.

The trio quickly formed a San Diego-based partnership to pursue development and investment opportunities in Southern California. The business achieved notable success over more than two decades ‚Äì largely due to continual reinvention and the team‚Äôs ability to leverage the peaks and troughs of the cyclical real estate industry.Gabriel‚Äôs sons, Graeme and Danny, took the helm in 2003 to build the next iteration of ColRich, creating a diverse residential platform that leverages a unique homebuilding background, renovation expertise, sophisticated in-house construction and design teams brought together in private capital partnerships. Today, ColRich is recognized as an industry leader for integrating design and value into both for-sale and multifamily rental properties.Total downloaded data  -  560gb | <a href="https://images.ransomware.live/screenshots/posts/8effb79e05035290e33be79d1df63dc8.png" target=_blank>üì∏</a> |

## **snatch**

> Snatch is a ransomware which infects victims by rebooting the PC into Safe Mode. Most of the existing security protections do not run in Safe Mode so that it the malware can act without expected countermeasures and it can encrypt as many files as it finds. It uses common packers such as UPX to hide its payload.
