Ransomware.live is a ransomware groups observatory based on [ransomwatch](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch) and inspired by [ransomlook](https://github.com/RansomLook/RansomLook). 

Ransomware.live is a ransomware leak site monitoring tool. It will scrape all of the entries on various ransomware leak sites and published them [here](recentposts.md).

>[!WARNING]
>Contents within ransomware.live, posts.json, groups.json and the docs/ & source/ directories are dynamically generated based on hosting choices of real-world threat actors in near-real-time.
whilst sanitisation efforts have been taken, by viewing or accessing ransomwatch you acknowledge you are doing so at your own risk.
